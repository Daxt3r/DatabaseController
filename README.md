# DatabaseController
Hello and welcome to my little project.

This programme came about as a result of another project. I wanted to manage images in the SQLite database for a game.
But in doing so, I encountered two major problems.
1. how do I store pictures in the SQLite database?
2. how do I load images from the SQLite database and display them in Unity?


The solution to the first problem is this resulting project. In its current state of development (16.12.2021) it is very rudimentary and will be developed further over time.
You can get a tutorial on this code by following this link. <link to the first tutorial part>.
For the second tutorial, the display of images from a database in Unity, follow this link <link to the second tutorial part>.
